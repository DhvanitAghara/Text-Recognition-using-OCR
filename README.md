# Text-Recognition-using-OCR

This project ‘Gujarati Text Recognition’ is used to detecting text from image and correctly 
recognize it. Model is trained to work for provided image as well as live image (through 
webcam) in python language. It can read on almost all types of image formats including JPEG,
PNG, BMP. The solution developed for this project consists of three major parts: image pre-
processing, character recognition (using deep learning based CNN) and character 
segmentation.

Model can recognize a word of more than one characters in English but can recognize only 
single character in Gujarati. Also, made comparison between the accuracy of model working 
on English dataset and Gujarati dataset.
